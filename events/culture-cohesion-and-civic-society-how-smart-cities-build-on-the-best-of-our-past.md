<p align="center"> On December 21st, 2020, the webinar “Culture, Cohesion and Civic Society: How Smart Cities Build on the Best of Our Past?” was successfully held by UEH-ISCM and its partners: UN-Habitat, Portland University, University of Groningen, HCMC Department of Urban Planning and Architecture, and Vienam German University. This webinar is on the line of SMARTCITY+ Rehabilitation and Reintegration Program of ISCM Event Series 2021.
Smart cities are often cast as the bridge to modernity; when our cities will be hyper connected and data-driven in design and function. The webinar explores how the preservation of socio-cultural assets of the past is foundational for social cohesion and
success, reflecting on three cases: Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi (Vietnam), Amsterdam (Netherlands) and Portland (USA) with shared experience from national and international experts.
