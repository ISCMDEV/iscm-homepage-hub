What do they got in there? King Kong? This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.

They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Just my luck, no ice. Yes, Yes, without the oops! Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Yes, Yes, without the oops! Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go!

Checkmate... Must go faster. You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?

Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? Just my luck, no ice.

Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. What do they got in there? King Kong? Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye!
