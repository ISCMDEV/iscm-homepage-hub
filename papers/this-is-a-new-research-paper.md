# So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs?

We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore! Yes, Yes, without the oops! Must go faster. God help us, we're in the hands of engineers.

Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Must go faster. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!

My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!

You really think you can fly that thing? Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Checkmate... Life finds a way. Checkmate... Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? Checkmate... My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard!
